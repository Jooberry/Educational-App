# Sports Dashboard

Sports fans want to be able to view relevant sporting events on a dashboard. With a sport of your choice, use an existing API or create a new API to display information about fixtures, news and travel information for events.

Possible APIs to use:

-   UFC: <http://ufc-data-api.ufc.com/api/v1/us>
-   Football: <http://api.football-data.org/index>
-   Triathalon: <https://developers.triathlon.org/docs>

## MVP

-   Display upcoming events on a map
-   Display results and ranking of players/teams
-   Allow users to add events to a favourites list

# Route Planner

Visit Scotland are look for ways to encourage people to walk and cycle. Your task is to create an app that allows users to search for cycling and hiking routes, view routes on a map, save routes to a wishlist and mark a route done.

You could use GoogleMaps Directions API:

-   <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/>

## MVP

Users should be able to:

-   Select start and finish locations for their route
-   Save routes to a wishlist
-   Mark completed routes as ‘done’

# Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

-   Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
-   Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus

## MVP

-   Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
-   Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content

Some samples of existing apps for inspiration:

-   <http://chemistryset.chemheritage.org/#/>
-   <http://www.royalmailheritage.com/main.php>
-   <http://education.iceandsky.com/>
-   <http://histography.io> - may only work in Safari

# Store Finder

Global pub giant Withoutaspoon, wants a pub finder that allows users to "Find your nearest store" for their website.

User should be able to enter their postcode or town or street name and get a list of the top ten nearest stores. Each store should have a distance, address, phone number, opening hours and a list of facilities and services (e.g. cash machine, car parking).

You'll have to build your own API to persist the store data and use an external api to find addresses from postcodes.

## MVP

-   Search by postcode or town or street name
-   A list of stores including the details of the stores
-   A map marking the stores
-   Use Geolocation to allow users to "use current location" to find stores

# Browser Game

Create a browser game based on an existing card or dice game. Model the game logic and then display it in the browser for a user to interact with.

Make your own MVP with some specific goals to be achieved based on the game you choose to model.

You might use persistence to keep track of the state of the game or track scores/wins. Other extended features will depend on the game you choose.
